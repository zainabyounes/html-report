    Television has been regarded as a powerful mass media and a popular source of entertainment. 
    But unfortunately, the abuse of television is causing much harm to our young people. 
    The situation is worsening day by day and so, it is high time we looked into the matter seriously. 
    Televisions telecast entertaining, informative and educative programmes but during the recent days, 
    they are screening obscene films and programmes of crime and violence. 
    It does not suit our culture and as a result, the young generation is going to astray. 
    They are getting involved in various anti-social activities. Even in America, 
    it has been found that TV programmes are influencing children’s behavior and learning style. 
    It is the case in Bangladesh too. Many are already addicted to television. 
    They spend hours together in front of this ‘magic box’ forgetting their homework and lesson. 
    Movies full of action and violence make them aggressive as well. 
    It is, no doubt, a very bad sign for our full of action and violence make them aggressive as well. 
    It is no doubt, a very bad sign for our future generation. We cannot let it go on anymore. 
    We must refrain our children and teenagers from watching TV at random.
    The government should also chalk out plans to control the telecast of immoral shows.
