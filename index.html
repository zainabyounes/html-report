            Earlier people used to resort to magazines and books as the sole source of entertainment. However,
            now, there are hundreds of options. 
            There are different channels on TV that are run on different frequencies. 
            The earlier Televisions were in monochrome,
            but with advancements in technology, TVs started coming in coloured versions.
            The main purpose of the TV was to bring the world closer. 
            While it became possible to a great extent. 
            However, it has also been responsible for the segregation of societal bonds.
            People prefer to stay and home than attend social obligations.
